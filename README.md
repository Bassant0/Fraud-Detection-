# Fraud-Detection-
Overview
Once those transactions that are fraudulent into two classes of legitimate (genuine) and fraudulent transactions 
The design of Descision tree architecture was based on supervised method, which was
applied to the transactions labled data to generate one of two answers fraud and not fraud model is
basically trained by using examples of both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Simulated
transactions dataset was used for testing and training are used
Data mining is a process that uses a variety of data analysis tools to uncover patterns and relationships in 
data that may be used to make accurate predictions. There are six basic steps of data mining process:
defining the problem, preparing data, exploring data, building models, exploring and validating models, 
deploying and updating models. Data mining is used to detect frauds because of its effectiveness, as it is a 
well-defined procedure that takes data as input and produces models as output. Decision tree, a data 
mining technique was meant to be used to detect the fraudulent activities.
The problem and its solution
Timely information on fraudulent activities is strategic to the banking industry. In a typical scenario for 
detecting fraud, the majority of transactions are legal, resulting in an imbalanced frequency distribution 
that poses a challenge for identifying illicit activity Although the detection software is capable of 
observing transactions, it lacks the ability to differentiate between transactions originating from lawful 
sources versus fraudulent ones. Consequently, the aim of the detection software is to accurately classify 
each transaction as either legitimate or fraudulent. Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying 
the transaction is detected as legitimate, it was processed but if any transaction labeled as
fraudulent . The fraudulent transaction will not be processed but will be committed to the database.
Steps to reach the goal 
The steps are select an appropriate algorithm; implement the algorithm in software; test the algorithm 
with known data set; evaluate and refine the algorithm as it is being tested with other known data sets; 
and show the results. Each transaction entering the database such as withdrawal, deposit, and any card 
transaction is treated as a signature, suspected and prone for verification. Suspected transactions are 
flagged within seconds for further investigations and subsequent decision-making The implemented 
architecture consists of two subsystems: database interface and credit card fraud (CCF) detection engine. 
The database interface subsystem is the entry point through which the transactions are read into the 
system. It is the systemâ€™s interface with the banking software. Each transaction entering into the system 
was passed to the host server where the corresponding transaction profile is further checked using neural 
networks and transactions business rules
